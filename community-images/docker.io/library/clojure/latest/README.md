Looking to ship library/clojure to production in a secure way without spending hours wrestling with your Dockerfiles? 

This community image example automatically hardens your application for production, reducing the size from 659 MB to 197 MB and removes 50 vulnerabilities along the way. 

This action starts by building an containerized application based off of the library/clojure image, and then runs it against its test suite found in the project folder.

Next, it uses the Slim.ai API to run the container hardening process and create a brand new container image containing fewer files, dependencies, and vulnerabilities â€” no new code required! The new container will then run against the same test suite to verify its functionality.
