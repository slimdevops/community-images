Looking to ship library/openjdk to production in a secure way without spending hours wrestling with your Dockerfiles? 

This community image example automatically hardens your application for production, reducing the size from 470 MB to 244 MB and removes 8 vulnerabilities along the way. 

Images labelled `Hello World` are meant to be starting points for application development. Simply replace the Hello World app code with your own and re-run the process for similar results. Standalone applications can be used as is, or reconfigured to meet your needs. 

The process starts by building an containerized application based off of the library/openjdk image, and then runs it against its test suite found in the project folder.

Next, we use Slim.AI to run the container hardening process and create a brand new container image, removing unnecessary files, dependencies, and vulnerabilities â€” no new code required! The new container will then run against the same test suite to verify its functionality.
