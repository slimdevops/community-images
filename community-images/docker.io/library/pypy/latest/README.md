Looking to ship library/pypy to production in a secure way without spending hours wrestling with your Dockerfiles? 

This community image example automatically hardens your application for production, reducing the size from 965 MB to 87 MB and removes 330 vulnerabilities along the way. 

This action starts by building an containerized application based off of the library/pypy image, and then runs it against its test suite found in the project folder.

Next, it uses the Slim.ai API to run the container hardening process and create a brand new container image containing fewer files, dependencies, and vulnerabilities â€” no new code required! The new container will then run against the same test suite to verify its functionality.
