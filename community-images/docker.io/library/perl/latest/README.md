Looking to ship library/perl to production in a secure way without spending hours wrestling with your Dockerfiles? 

This community image example automatically hardens your application for production, reducing the size from 894 MB to 8.5 MB and removes 328 vulnerabilities along the way. 

This action starts by building an containerized application based off of the library/perl image, and then runs it against its test suite found in the project folder.

Next, it uses the Slim.ai API to run the container hardening process and create a brand new container image containing fewer files, dependencies, and vulnerabilities â€” no new code required! The new container will then run against the same test suite to verify its functionality.
